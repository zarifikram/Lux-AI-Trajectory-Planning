# Lux AI Trajectory Planning
 A snipper of my contribution in LUX AI challange solution

Here we did not use any ML model, we just used some simple heuristics to find the best path for the agent to reach the destination. The reason is that the solution needs to be fast. We, therefore, had to sacrifice the accuracy for the speed. The solution is not perfect, but it is fast enough to get a good score.
